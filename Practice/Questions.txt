Array-1: Given a list of numbers and a no. k, find if any two numbers from the list add upto k.

LL-1: Linked list insertion, count no. of nodes in list recursively

Array-2: Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the      numbers in the original array except the one at i.
        For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

RichestBegger-RCB 
        Akash has recenty joined a new company and on his first day at office his colleague Mr. Goyal (who is always ready to mock him :XD) gave him an interesting problem to solve.

        Assume N beggars, numbered from 1 to N are standing outside a temple. It is given that 'k' people visit the temple on that partucular day.

        Every person who comes out of the temple selects some beggars from 'l' to 'r' and gives each beggar from 'l' to 'r' 1$ each.

        The task is to find out the beggar (or beggars) who gets the maximum amount of money at the end of the day.

        Akash does not want to get insulted on the first day, so he has asked you to help him.

        Input
        The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the number of beggars.

        The second line contains an integer 'k' denoting the number of people who visit the temple.

        Each of the next k lines contains two integers 'l' and 'r'.

        Output
        The first line of output contains the maximum amount of money a beggar gets.

        The next line consists the beggars who get the maximum amount of money at the end of the day.

        Constraints
        1<=N<=2*100000

        1<=k<=100000

        1<=l,r<=100000

        Example
        Input:
        6
        3
        1 3
        2 4
        5 6

        Output:
        2
        2 3

3Divisor - Given a positive integer value N. The task is to find how many numbers less than or equal to N have numbers of divisors exactly equal to 3.

        Example 1:

        Input:
        N = 6
        Output: 1
        Explanation: The only number with 
        3 divisor is 4.
        
        Example 2:

        Input:
        N = 10
        Output: 2
        Explanation: 4 and 9 have 3 divisors.

        Your Task:
        You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function exactly3Divisors() that takes N as input parameter and returns count of numbers less than or equal to N with exactly 3 divisors.

        Expected Time Complexity : O(N1/2 * N1/4)
        Expected Auxilliary Space :  O(1)

        Constraints :
        1 <= N <= 109
